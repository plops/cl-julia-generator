    + maximize stiffness
    + same as minizing elastic energy: c = .5 U.T @ K @ U
    + static equation: K @ U = F
      - K stiffness matrix
      - unknown U is displacement
    + design variables: rho_i \in [0,1]
    + volume constraint: g = \sum_i (\rho_i - V_o) <=0
  - derivative of objective function with respect to design variable
  - update \rho_i

    - topology optimization for additive manufacturing 1/4
    - volume constraint not over full domain but in count local
      elements in local neighborhood
      \hat\rho_i < \alpha \forall i
      \hat\rho_i = \frac{\sum_{j\in\Omega_i}
      \rho_j}{\sum_{j\in\Omega_i} 1}

    - 2/4
    - bone-like microstructure
      - better for
	- changing force direction
	- removal of material

    - additive manufacturing 3/4
    - 60 deg needs support structure
    - internal support structure that balances model and needs no removal
    - rhombic lattice pattern looks like a quadtree

    - 4/4
    - distortion in metal additive manufacturing
      - reduce by adding curved layers
    - support building robot during fabrication of bridge
    - implant with sparse material at the outside to stimulate
      bone-ingrowth
